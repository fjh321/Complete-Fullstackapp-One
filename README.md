## What I did to build this app:
This fullstack app involves a to-do list with back-end server code that updates each to-do list item with a strikethrough style to show it as complete or incomplete.

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to code this project

My aim with this project was to make it straight forward and easy to use while implementing a simple PUT CRUD request on the backend instead of opting for front end DOM changes.

## Lessons Learned :
* I learned how to manipulate my webpage better from the backend and implementing changes with CRUD updates.
* I have a better grasp of CRUD in general now and see it uses in implementing changes server-side to prevent client side maniupulation if, for example, someone were to use their browser dev tools and change front end code.
* I got better at debugging on the backend and became more familiar with backend infrastructure because of it.
